# angular-week-schedule
An Angular directive for displaying events on a weekly schedule

The main use for this directive is to display events on a weekly schedule (Like a fixed work schedule, school class schedule, etc). It allows for events overlapping with their times and automatically handles displaying these events side by side rather than overlapping them visually.
